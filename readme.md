# mining-mon - Mining tools for Windows

Complete solution for mining software management with integrated monitoring and watchdog

![miner-mon screenshot](docs/images/screenshot.png)

## Features
- Hardware monitoring (CPU temp, FAN speed, GPU power usage, GPU memory clocks, GPU clocks)
- Miner monitoring (hashrate, shares)
- Watchdog with miner restart (internet connection monitoring, mining software responsiveness, accepted shares increase)
- Log files for easier retracing what was happening the the miner
- WWW server for easier log access and server metrics
- Pushover.net integration for mobile notifications
- Autoupdate
- Nice console UI ðŸ˜Š

## Supported hardware
- NVIDIA cards only - sorry AMD

## Supported miners
- [Claymore's Dual Miner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1433925.0) (both single and dual modes) 
- [CCMiner](https://github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases) (in progress....) 

## Requirements
- git client 
- nodejs v9.9.0+

## Installation & configuration
1. After checking out the repository run: `npm install`
2. Place config files in mining-mon root directory. See `config-examples` directory for details

App reads config in order:
1. `worker.conf` (general worker / rig configuration like worker name, wallets, pools etc.), 
2. `run.conf` (miner and monitor configuration, what and how to mine)
3. `run-${worker_name}.conf` (worker specific configuration)

You can use all configuration files at once. It all depends what is your preferred way of configuring workers. If you own only one mining server - just one file - `run.conf` should be fine. Variables from later override existing variables. You can use variables in `${variable}` format. Either `run.conf` or `run-${worker_name}.conf` is required.

## Web server
App serves `/status.json` and `/rig_state.json` files. App logs are accessible in `/log` dir. Current mining app log file is accessible at `/log/run.log`. Current miner log file is accessible at `/log/miner.log`
Default web server port is `8181`
